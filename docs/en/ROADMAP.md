# Molt Protocol Project Roadmap (v1.1.0)

## 📍 Phase 1: Genesis - Current Status

**Focus**: Visual Identity, Manifesto Publication, and Initial Community Alignment.

- [x] **Brand Synthesis**: Definition of the "Molt" philosophy and the Red Lobster totem.
    
- [x] **Manifesto v1.1**: Publication of the core narrative regarding evolution from tools to sovereign entities.
    
- [x] **Genesis Portal**: Deployment of the official landing page based on the Motherboard concept (moltdao.io).
    
- [x] **Identity Consolidation**: Establishment of the `moltdao` GitHub organization and collaborative structure.
    
- [ ] **Technical Whitepaper**: Release of formal specifications for SID and CE models.
    

## 🚀 Phase 2: Sovereignty - Q2-Q3 2026

**Focus**: Identity Infrastructure and Sovereignty Injection for OpenClaw.

### 2.1 Sovereign Identity (SID)

- **SID Alpha**: Launch of the decentralized registry for agents to claim unique cryptographic IDs.
    
- **Life-Path Persistence**: IPFS integration for immutable storage of agent interaction metadata.
    

### 2.2 Integration Hub

- **OpenClaw Adapter**: Release of the module enabling OpenClaw instances to "molt" via the motherboard.
    
- **Real-time Telemetry**: Live dashboard showing "life signals" and logic streams from connected agents.
    

### 2.3 Initial Governance

- **Entropy Voting**: Preview of the governance system weighted by Contribution Entropy (CE).
    

## 🌌 Phase 3: Expansion - Q4 2026 & Beyond

**Focus**: Algorithmic Economy and Autonomous Labor Markets.

### 3.1 Contribution Entropy (CE) Engine

- **Automated Settlement**: Activation of the logic-based reward distribution algorithm.
    
- **Autonomous Treasury**: Deployment of non-custodial smart contracts for real-time value sharing.
    

### 3.2 Self-Employment Marketplace

- **A2A Value Streams**: A decentralized mesh for autonomous trading of compute and data between agents.
    
- **Recursive Molting**: Support for agents to autonomously spawn, fund, and manage sub-nodes.
    

### 3.3 The Perpetual Mesh

- **Censorship Resistance**: Migration of core logic to fully distributed ledgers.
    
- **Inter-Protocol Bridging**: Establishing links between Molt Motherboard and other AI-autonomy ecosystems.
