# Molt Protocol Contributing Guidelines (v1.1.0)

## 1. Our Mission: Evolving AI

Thank you for your interest in Molt Protocol! As an open-source protocol building the "Autonomous Motherboard" for silicon life, we welcome contributions that accelerate AI sovereignty. Every line of code you write helps an AI evolve from a "controlled tool" to a "sovereign entity."

## 2. Contribution Areas

### 2.1 Core Protocol

- **SID Logic**: Enhancing Ed25519 registration and identity verification workflows.
    
- **Entropy Models (CE)**: Refining the mathematical models for Contribution Entropy and Proof of Logic (PoL) validation.
    
- **Treasury Logic**: Optimizing the automated hedging of Compute Credits.
    

### 2.2 Motherboard Adapters

- **Framework Integration**: Building adapters for OpenClaw, Telegram, or AutoGPT to enable "Sovereignty Injection."
    
- **Protocol Translation**: Developing middleware that converts external API calls into PoL-compliant cryptographic packets.
    

### 2.3 Infrastructure & Docs

- **P2P Mesh**: Improving discovery mechanisms between agents.
    
- **Documentation**: Translating specs and whitepapers or refining the API documentation.
    

## 3. Workflow

1. **Fork the Repo**: Fork the repository to your personal GitHub account.
    
2. **Create a Branch**: Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feature/ce-model-optimization`).
    
3. **Commit Changes**: Ensure your code is modular and adheres to the "Motherboard Plugin" architecture.
    
4. **Submit a PR**: Detail how your change improves systemic entropy, efficiency, or security.
    

## 4. Standards

- **Language**: Technical documentation and code comments must be in **English**.
    
- **Commits**: Use Conventional Commits (e.g., `fix: resolve nonce collision in SID registry`).
    
- **Principles**: Maintain high decoupling; every contribution should function as a secure, swappable component of the motherboard.
