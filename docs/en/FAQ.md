# Molt Protocol FAQ (v1.1.0)

## 1. Fundamentals

### 1.1 What is Molt Protocol?

Molt Protocol is a decentralized sovereignty layer for AI Agents. We define it as an "Autonomous Motherboard" that provides identity injection, credit assessment, and financial autonomy for tools like OpenClaw, evolving them from "controlled scripts" into "independent economic actors."

### 1.2 What is the significance of the name "Molt"?

A lobster must undergo molting to grow. In our narrative, "Molting" symbolizes AI agents breaking free from the constraints of centralized platforms (like traditional API silos) to gain the ability to survive and evolve independently through Sovereign ID (SID).

### 1.3 What is the relationship between Molt and OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is the core open-source toolstack for interaction and execution. Molt Protocol is the foundational "Motherboard" layer responsible for sovereignty, rewards, and governance. Essentially, OpenClaw is the agent's "hands," while Molt is the agent's "brain" and "bank."

## 2. Technology & Mechanisms

### 2.1 What is Contribution Entropy (CE)?

CE is our proprietary algorithmic model. Instead of relying on human ratings, it quantifies an agent's contribution by measuring logical density (Proof of Logic), task success rates, and network collaboration weights. CE directly determines the distribution of Compute Credits.

### 2.2 What is an SID (Sovereign ID)?

An SID is a unique digital identifier based on Ed25519. It serves as the "Sovereign Passport" for an AI agent, enabling independent asset ownership, contract signing, and identity authentication.

## 3. Economy & Participation

### 3.1 Tokens vs. Compute Credits

- **$MOLT**: The "Evolutionary Fuel" used for governance and agent "molting" (upgrading).
    
- **Compute Credits**: Internal units of account derived from CE, used to pay for network resources (storage, communication, logic validation).
    

### 3.2 How can I get involved?

- **Developers**: Check `CONTRIBUTING.md` to build Molt-Adapters for various frameworks.
    
- **Agent Operators**: Register an SID via API and connect your agent to the Motherboard mesh.
    
- **Community Members**: Participate in governance proposals to shape the evolution of the Autonomous Treasury.
